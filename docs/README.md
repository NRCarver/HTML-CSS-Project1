Code Institute: Project 1 using HTML and CSS

Visit the website here

The brief was to create a static front-end website using both HTML and CSS and with a minimum of 3 pages or page areas that presents useful information to the user.


INSERT IMAGE OF WEBSITE ON VARIOUS SCREENS

My website (LifeHacks) has been created to help people learn all sorts of different tips and tricks that can save them time and money in their everyday life. I also have a section on the site of users to submit their own tips so that the website will become a living, up to date, library of knowledge for my users.

The website is split into 3 sections:

1. Home 
2. LifeHacks
3. Submit Your Hacks

The business goals of the website are:

1. To inform users of lifehacks that they dont know and improve their lives.
2. Build a base of repeat visitors who find repeat value in the website.
3. Once visitor traffic is sufficient, sell advertising space.
4. Once visitor traffic is sufficient, partner with businesses who would help our users with 'sponsored' LifeHacks.

The user goals of the website:

1. As a first time visitor I want to find out exactly what a Life Hack is.
2. As a first time visitor I want to find out some new tips and tricks that can save me time and money.
3. I want to share my Life Hacks with a community who will appreciate it via the website.
4. As a repeat visitor I want to find the newest solutions to problems I might be having.


UX

Strategy

With the core principles of UX in mind I had to think about who my target audience for my website is and what layout and features they would find most appealing. 

I concluded that my target audience are:

1. Looking to solve minor annoyances they have.
2. Looking for ways to save money.
3. Looking for ways to save time. 
4. Interested in trying new things.
5. Age 16+

What my users would be searching for:

1. Clear and concise information.
2. A wide range of subjects to be available.
3. Easy navigation to the subject you want to see.
4. A place to enter their own submissions.

My website aims to fit all of these. The navigation of the site is clear and simple with a fixed header that can take you to anywhere on the website. The information is broken down into simple catagories and in time, with more content could be even more precise.

Given that I have such a large age range as my target audience, I chose to keep the colour scheme quite simple so that it should appeal to all.

Scope

With my business goals and desired users defined I decided what I wanted to include in my project now, and what would have to wait till a later release. The features I wanted to make now were:

1. Clear Header with my logo and navigation bar linking to various sections of the website.
2. Immediate information for the user on what a life hack is.
3. A 'Hacks' section with information seperated by theme.
4. A submission form so users can submit forms that can later be added to the website.
5. A footer with links to social media pages.

Structure 

Initially I made a website with 3 seperate pages that link between them and this is still what I envision the website becoming. Unfortunately as I was building the website it was clear that over 3 pages, the content would look very thin so instead I have created a single page website with a clear flow. Users are initially met with the website explaining Life Hacks, then showing them the hacks, then with a form asking for their hacks to help grow the page. The navigation bar allows for quick navigation if returning users want to skip ahead.

Skeleton

As mentioned under 'Structure', I initially envisioned the website as 3 seperate pages think it will become so in the future once we have had some submissions and a larger number of hacks to fill out the pages.

As a consequence, my wireframes show the website on 3 pages. When changing the website to a single page, it was a pretty simple transition. I simply places the pages in the same order vertically to preserve the flow of the site.

To keep the website scalable, I wanted to have collapsible boxes for the information so the user is not overwhelmed. I also wanted to keep the initial landing page simple and easily digestible for the same reason.

I also wanted to put in a collapsible navigation menu for smaller screens so the website is easily accessible for users on the go, making it easy for users to pop in and out of the site often.

Surface

Given the broad target audience, I chose blue as my primary colour and white and pink as secondary colours. I did want the site to be confident so selected a strong shade of blue (245, 245, 245) and light background images to give the site an appealing contrast. All of the buttons.

I chose my main font as Montserrat from Google Fonts. It is a strong font originally developed from old posters and signs and so would fit the purpose well of easily digestible short chunks of information.

Features

The website is fully responsible and consists of a header, a footer and 3 main sections:The landing page and description, the Life Hacks and the submission form for users. 

Header/Navbar

The header at the top of the page has links to all other sections of the website and the LifeHacks logo that I created for the website. It is fixed to the top of the page allowing for quick navigation from any part of the page. For smaller screens the navigation in the header collapses into a collapsible menu with just the word 'Menu' and a list icon.

Landing Page

The landing page is the first page of the website and gives the user a simple introduction to LifeHacks and lets them know about the large potential scope for them. It also has a large hero image that fits the colour scheme for the website and also has a parrallax effect when scrolling making the site look more professional.

Hacks

The Hacks section has a title and a sentance of text encouraging the user to select a catagory of life hack for the user to explore. The vertical list also changes colour when hovering over a catagory and the text inside is a softer version of my main blue colour providing a nice contrast for the user. I have also added matching icons from FontAwesome to each of the categories to make the page more appealing.

Submit Your Hacks

The submission section has a form on background hero image with a grading pink colour. Again I used a parrallax effect on the background and it contrast nicely from the white of the above sections. The form asks for the users information so we can keep in touch with them and give credit for the hack that they are submitting. The form requires 3 text elements, 1 email element and a radio button selection to describe the type of hack you are submitting. I used the same colour scheme here but with white text on the blue background as it matches the white thought bubble in the image and makes the form more appealing, hopefully leading to more submissions.
